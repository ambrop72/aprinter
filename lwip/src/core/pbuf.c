/**

 * Packet buffer management
 *
 * Packets are built from the pbuf data structure. It supports dynamic
 * memory allocation for packet contents or can reference externally
 * managed packet contents both in RAM and ROM. Quick allocation for
 * incoming packets is provided through pools with fixed sized pbufs.
 *
 * A packet may span over multiple pbufs, chained as a singly linked
 * list. This is called a "pbuf chain".
 *
 * Multiple packets may be queued, also using this singly linked list.
 * This is called a "packet queue".
 * 
 * So, a packet queue consists of one or more pbuf chains, each of
 * which consist of one or more pbufs. CURRENTLY, PACKET QUEUES ARE
 * NOT SUPPORTED!!! Use helper structs to queue multiple packets.
 * 
 * The differences between a pbuf chain and a packet queue are very
 * precise but subtle. 
 *
 * The last pbuf of a packet has a ->tot_len field that equals the
 * ->len field. It can be found by traversing the list. If the last
 * pbuf of a packet has a ->next field other than NULL, more packets
 * are on the queue.
 *
 * Therefore, looping through a pbuf of a single packet, has an
 * loop end condition (tot_len == p->len), NOT (next == NULL).

 * Allocates a pbuf of the given type (possibly a chain for PBUF_POOL type).
 *
 * The actual memory allocated for the pbuf is determined by the
 * layer at which the pbuf is allocated and the requested size
 * (from the size parameter).
 *
 * @param layer flag to define header size
 * @param length size of the pbuf's payload
 * @param type this parameter decides how and where the pbuf
 * should be allocated as follows:
 *
 * - PBUF_ROM: no buffer memory is allocated for the pbuf, even for
 *             protocol headers. Additional headers must be prepended
 *             by allocating another pbuf and chain in to the front of
 *             the ROM pbuf. It is assumed that the memory used is really
 *             similar to ROM in that it is immutable and will not be
 *             changed. Memory which is dynamic should generally not
 *             be attached to PBUF_ROM pbufs. Use PBUF_REF instead.
 * - PBUF_REF: no buffer memory is allocated for the pbuf, even for
 *             protocol headers. It is assumed that the pbuf is only
 *             being used in a single thread. If the pbuf gets queued,
 *             then pbuf_take should be called to copy the buffer.
 * - PBUF_POOL: the pbuf is allocated as a pbuf chain, with pbufs from
 *              the pbuf pool that is allocated during pbuf_init().
 *
 * @return the allocated pbuf. If multiple pbufs where allocated, this
 * is the first pbuf of a pbuf chain.
